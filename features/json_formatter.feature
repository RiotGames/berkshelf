Feature: --format json
  As a user
  I want to be able to get all output in JSON format
  So I can easily parse the output in scripts

  Background:
    Given the Berkshelf API server's cache is empty
    And the Chef Server is empty
    And the cookbook store is empty

  Scenario: JSON output installing a cookbook from the default location
    Given I write to "Berksfile" with:
      """
      source "http://localhost:26210"

      cookbook 'berkshelf', '1.0.0'
      """
    And the Chef Server has cookbooks:
      | berkshelf | 1.0.0 |
    And the Berkshelf API server's cache is up to date
    When I successfully run `berks install --format json`
    Then the output should contain JSON:
      """
      {
        "cookbooks": [
          {
            "version": "1.0.0",

        ],
        "messages": [
          "building universe..."
        ]
      }
      """

  Scenario: JSON output installing a cookbook we already have
    Given the cookbook store has the cookbooks:
      | berkshelf-cookbook-fixture   | 1.0.0 |
    And I write to "Berksfile" with:
