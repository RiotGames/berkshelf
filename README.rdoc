= Knife Cookbook Dependencies

A knife plugin to retrieve cookbook dependencies.

== Getting Started

=== Install

    $ gem install knife_cookbook_dependencies

=== Use

==== Cookbookfile

Dependencies are managed via a `Cookbookfile` in the directory where you want the cookbooks to be installed.  The Cookbookfile, like Bundler's Gemfile, contains which cookbooks are needed and, optionally, where to find them:

    cookbook 'memcached'
    cookbook 'nginx'
    cookbook 'my_app', path: '/path/to/cookbook'
    cookbook 'mysql', git: 'git://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql.git'

==== CLI

The CLI consists of 3 commands: install, update, clean

    $ knife cookbook dependencies (install|update) [(--without|-W) group_to_exclude]
    $ knife cookbook dependencies clean

note::

    `knife cookbook dependencies` subcommands can be used by its alias `knife cookbook deps`

[install]  Installs the from the Cookbookfile.lock, or Cookbookfile if the the lockfile does not exist.

[update] Skips the lockfile and installs fresh

[clean] Removes all of the files managed by the `Cookbookfile`, including the `Cookbookfile.lock`, temp directory used for downloads and extractions and the cookbooks directory.

== The Cookbookfile

Cookbooks are defined as dependencies by declaring them in the `Cookbookfile`

    cookbook 'nginx'

Cookbooks without additional options are assumed to come from the Opscode Community site at the latest available version: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks

Options available include:

version constraint

    cookbook "nginx", "= 0.101.2"    # precisely 0.101.2
    cookbook "mysql", "< 1.2.4"      # less than and not including 1.2.4
    cookbook "openssl", "~> 1.0.0"   # greater than 1.0.0, and up to but not including 1.1.0

git

    # ref can be a branch name, tag, or commit hash. If ref is not provided, HEAD is used.
    cookbook "mysql", git: "https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql.git", ref: "<any git ref>" 

path

    # knife cookbook dependencies will look in /path/to/location/of/my_application for the cookbook
    cookbook "my_application", path: "/path/to/location/of"

=== Groups

Groups can be defined via blocks or inline as an option:

    group :solo do
      cookbook 'base'
    end
    
    cookbook 'base', :group => 'solo'

When using install or update, groups can be excluded with the --without GROUP_NAME or -W GROUP_NAME flags.
